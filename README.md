Welcome! The open-cluster-management.io project is focused on enabling end-to-end visibility and control across your Kubernetes clusters.

The Open Cluster Management (OCM) architecture uses a hub - agent model. The hub centralizes control of all the managed clusters. An agent, which we call the klusterlet, resides on each managed cluster to manage registration to the hub and run instructions from the hub.

OCM is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) sandbox project](https://www.cncf.io/projects/open-cluster-management).

You can use the [clusteradm CLI](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/clusteradm) to bootstrap a control plane for multicluster management. The following diagram illustrates the deployment architecture for OCM:

To setup a multicluster environment with OCM enabled on your local machine, follow the instructions in [setup dev environment](solutions/setup-dev-environment).

There are a number of key use cases that are enabled by this project, and are categorized to 3 sub projects.

### Cluster Lifecycle: Cluster registration and management

OCM has a group of [APIs](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/api) to provide the foundational functions
in multiple cluster management.

The journey of cluster management starts with [Cluster Registration](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/registration) which follows a `double opt-in` protocol to establish a MTLS connection from the agent on the managed cluster (Klusterlet) to the hub (Cluster Manager). After this, users or operands on the hub can declare [ManifestWorks](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/work) which contains a slice of Kubernetes resource manifests to be distributed and applied to a certain managed cluster. To schedule workloads to a certain set of clusters, users can also declare a [Placement](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/placement) on the hub to dynamically select a set of clusters with certain criteria.

In addition, developers can leverage [Addon framework](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework) to build their own management tools or integrate with other open source projects to extend the multicluster management capability. OCM maintaines two built-in addons for application lifecycle and security governance.

### Application Lifecycle: Delivery, upgrade, and configuration of applications on Kubernetes clusters

* Centrally create, update, and delete Kubernetes clusters across multiple private and public clouds.
* Automatically deploy applications to specific clusters by subscribing to different workload (resource) channels, such as GitHub, Helm repository, ObjectStore, and resource templates.

The application model defines a Kubernetes-first way of describing the application. Your existing Kubernetes apps or `kustomized` apps can be adapted with the addition of a few new objects: [Channel](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/multicloud-operators-channel), and [Subscription](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/multicloud-operators-subscription). Changes made to the app are then easily delivered to managed clusters based on the dynamic placement engine. See [deploy a helm chart](solutions/deploy-a-helm-chart) on how
to install application manager addon in OCM and deploy helm charts in multiple clusters.

### GRC: Governance, Risk and Compliance across Kubernetes clusters

* Use prebuilt security and configuration controllers to enforce policies on Kubernetes configuration across your clusters.

Policy controllers allow the declarative expression of a desired condition that can be audited or enforced against a set of managed clusters. _Policies_ allow you to drive cross-cluster configuration or validate that a certain configuration explicitly does not exist.


The following repositories describe the underlying API and controllers for the GRC model:

* https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/config-policy-controller
* https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/governance-policy-status-sync
* https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/governance-policy-spec-sync
* https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/governance-policy-template-sync
* https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/governance-policy-propagator

### More external integrations

We are constantly working with other open source projects to make multicluster management easier.

- [Submariner](https://submariner.io/) is a project that provides multicluster networking connectivity. Users can benefit from a [Submariner](https://submariner.io/) addon, which automates the deployment and management of multicluster networking.
- [Clusternet](http://github.com/clusternet/clusternet) is another project that provides multicluster orchestration, which can be easily plug into OCM with [clusternet addon](https://github.com/skeeey/clusternet-addon)
- [KubeVela](https://kubevela.io/) is a modern application delivery platform that makes deploying and operating applications across today's hybrid, multi-cloud environments easier, faster and more reliable. Note that OCM is also available as an [vela addon](https://github.com/kubevela/catalog/tree/master/addons/ocm-hub-control-plane) in KubeVela.
