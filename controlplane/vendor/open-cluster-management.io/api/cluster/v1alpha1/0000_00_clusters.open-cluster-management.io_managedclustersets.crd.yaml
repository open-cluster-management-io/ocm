The service exposed by the workload can be shared in any ManagedCluster in the ManagedClusterSet \n In order to assign a ManagedCluster to a certian ManagedClusterSet, add a label with name `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset` on the ManagedCluster to refers to the ManagedClusterSet. User is not allow to add/remove this label on a ManagedCluster unless they have a RBAC rule to CREATE on a virtual subresource of managedclustersets/join.
