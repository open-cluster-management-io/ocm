        description: "CloudPrivateIPConfig performs an assignment of a private IP
          address to the primary NIC associated with cloud VMs. This is done by specifying
          the IP and Kubernetes node which the IP should be assigned to. This CRD
          is intended to be used by the network plugin which manages the cluster network.
          The spec side represents the desired state requested by the network plugin,
          and the status side represents the current state that this CRD's controller
          has executed. No users will have permission to modify it, and if a cluster-admin
          decides to edit it for some reason, their changes will be overwritten the
          next time the network plugin reconciles the object. Note: the CR's name
          must specify the requested private IP address (can be IPv4 or IPv6). \n
          Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12
          months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer)."
