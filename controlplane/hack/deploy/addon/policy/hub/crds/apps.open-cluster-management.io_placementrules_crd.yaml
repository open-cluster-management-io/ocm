                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs.  1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.  2.
                    Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                    individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular     restrictions
                    like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored"
                    or "name must be restricted".     Those cannot be well described
                    when embedded.  3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                    are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.  4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity     during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple     and the version of the actual
                    struct is irrelevant.  5. We cannot easily change it.  Because
                    this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type     will
                    affect numerous schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:
                    https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

                        field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                        a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                        (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
