          Klusterlet represents controllers to install the resources for a managed cluster.
          When configured, the Klusterlet requires a secret named bootstrap-hub-kubeconfig in the
          agent namespace to allow API requests to the hub for the registration protocol.
          In Hosted mode, the Klusterlet requires an additional secret named external-managed-kubeconfig
          in the agent namespace to allow API requests to the managed cluster for resources installation.

                        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                        This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.
