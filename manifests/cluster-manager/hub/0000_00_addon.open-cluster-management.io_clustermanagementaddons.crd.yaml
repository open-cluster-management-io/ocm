          ClusterManagementAddOn represents the registration of an add-on to the cluster manager.
          This resource allows you to discover which add-ons are available for the cluster manager
          and provides metadata information about the add-ons. The ClusterManagementAddOn name is used
          for the namespace-scoped ManagedClusterAddOn resource.
          ClusterManagementAddOn is a cluster-scoped resource.
