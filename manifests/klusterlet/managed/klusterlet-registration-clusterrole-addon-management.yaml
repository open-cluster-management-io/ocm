# Addition ClusterRole permission for registration agent
# Registration agent needs these permission to manage addons whose agents runs in managed cluster while registration 
# agent itself runs in the management cluster. For example, if klusterlet is deployed in hosted mode, but an addon is 
# deployed in default mode, then the registration agent runs outside the managed cluster and the addon agents run on 
# the managed cluster.
