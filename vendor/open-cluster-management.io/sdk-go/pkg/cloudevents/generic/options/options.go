	// Receive starts receiving events and invokes the provided handler for each event.
	// This is a BLOCKING call that runs an event loop until the context is cancelled.
	// The handler function is called synchronously for each received event.
	// This method should typically be run in a separate goroutine.
	//
	// The method returns when:
	//   - The context is cancelled (returns ctx.Err())
	//   - A fatal transport error occurs (returns the error)
	//
	// Note: The handler should avoid blocking operations to prevent blocking the
	// reception of subsequent events. For blocking operations, dispatch to a separate
	// goroutine within the handler.

	// ErrorChan returns a read-only channel that receives asynchronous transport errors.
	// These errors may include connection failures, protocol errors, or other transport-level issues.
	// The channel is closed when Close() is called on the transport.
