          ManagedCluster represents the desired state and current status
          of a managed cluster. ManagedCluster is a cluster-scoped resource. The name
          is the cluster UID.

          The cluster join process is a double opt-in process. See the following join process steps:

          1. The agent on the managed cluster creates a CSR on the hub with the cluster UID and agent name.
          2. The agent on the managed cluster creates a ManagedCluster on the hub.
          3. The cluster admin on the hub cluster approves the CSR for the UID and agent name of the ManagedCluster.
          4. The cluster admin sets the spec.acceptClient of the ManagedCluster to true.
          5. The cluster admin on the managed cluster creates a credential of the kubeconfig for the hub cluster.

          After the hub cluster creates the cluster namespace, the klusterlet agent on the ManagedCluster pushes
          the credential to the hub cluster to use against the kube-apiserver of the ManagedCluster.
