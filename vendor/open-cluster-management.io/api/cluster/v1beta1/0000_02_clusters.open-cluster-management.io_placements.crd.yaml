          Placement defines a rule to select a set of ManagedClusters from the ManagedClusterSets bound
          to the placement namespace.


          Here is how the placement policy combines with other selection methods to determine a matching
          list of ManagedClusters:
           1. Kubernetes clusters are registered with hub as cluster-scoped ManagedClusters;
           2. ManagedClusters are organized into cluster-scoped ManagedClusterSets;
           3. ManagedClusterSets are bound to workload namespaces;
           4. Namespace-scoped Placements specify a slice of ManagedClusterSets which select a working set
              of potential ManagedClusters;
           5. Then Placements subselect from that working set using label/claim selection.


          A ManagedCluster will not be selected if no ManagedClusterSet is bound to the placement
          namespace. A user is able to bind a ManagedClusterSet to a namespace by creating a
          ManagedClusterSetBinding in that namespace if they have an RBAC rule to CREATE on the virtual
          subresource of `managedclustersets/bind`.


          A slice of PlacementDecisions with the label cluster.open-cluster-management.io/placement={placement name}
          will be created to represent the ManagedClusters selected by this placement.


          If a ManagedCluster is selected and added into the PlacementDecisions, other components may
          apply workload on it; once it is removed from the PlacementDecisions, the workload applied on
          this ManagedCluster should be evicted accordingly.

                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a placement can
