                  registrationConfig is defined, a csr will be created for each registration configuration. It is not allowed that
                  multiple registrationConfigs have the same signer name. After the csr is approved on the hub cluster, the klusterlet
                  agent will create a secret in the installNamespace for the registrationConfig. If the signerName is
                  "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client", the secret name will be "{addon name}-hub-kubeconfig" whose contents includes
                  key/cert and kubeconfig. Otherwise, the secret name will be "{addon name}-{signer name}-client-cert" whose contents includes key/cert.
