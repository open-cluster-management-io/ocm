          AppliedManifestWork represents an applied manifestwork on managed cluster that is placed
          on a managed cluster. An AppliedManifestWork links to a manifestwork on a hub recording resources
          deployed in the managed cluster.
          When the agent is removed from managed cluster, cluster-admin on managed cluster
          can delete appliedmanifestwork to remove resources deployed by the agent.
          The name of the appliedmanifestwork must be in the format of
          {hash of hub's first kube-apiserver url}-{manifestwork name}

                  AppliedResources represents a list of resources defined within the manifestwork that are applied.
                  Only resources with valid GroupVersionResource, namespace, and name are suitable.
                  An item in this slice is deleted when there is no mapped manifest in manifestwork.Spec or by finalizer.
                  The resource relating to the item will also be removed from managed cluster.
                  The deleted resource may still be present until the finalizers for that resource are finished.
                  However, the resource will not be undeleted, so it can be removed from this list and eventual consistency is preserved.

                    - the appliedmanifestwork hub hash does not match the current hub hash of the work agent.
