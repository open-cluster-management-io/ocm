      description: AppliedManifestWork represents an applied manifestwork on managed cluster that is placed on a managed cluster. An AppliedManifestWork links to a manifestwork on a hub recording resources deployed in the managed cluster. When the agent is removed from managed cluster, cluster-admin on managed cluster can delete appliedmanifestwork to remove resources deployed by the agent. The name of the appliedmanifestwork must be in the format of {hash of hub's first kube-apiserver url}-{manifestwork name}

However, the resource will not be undeleted, so it can be removed from this list and eventual consistency is preserved.
